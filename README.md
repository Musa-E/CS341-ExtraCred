# Back-Alley
A weird eso-lang I'm working on.

You must have gcc.

Copy and paste the main.cpp into a .cpp file, use the command prompt and cd into the directory.
then type g++ name.cpp where name is the name of your file.
then just type name (Directory of the Back Alley code + extension)
name hello.txt

Then you will get something like
Finished!

Output: 
Hello, World!

Have fun!
